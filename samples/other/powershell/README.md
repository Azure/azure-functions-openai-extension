# OpenAI Bindings - PowerShell Samples

This project contains sample code for using the OpenAI bindings with Azure Functions for PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

* Please refer Azure Functions PowerShell [supported versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-powershell?tabs=portal#powershell-versions).
* Install the corresponding version of [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
* Please refer to the root level [README](../../../README.md#requirements) for prerequisites.

## Configure the Function App

If using Azure OpenAI, update the deployment name to model property in function.json for textCompletion input binding or use it to override the default model value for OpenAI.

```json
{
    "type": "textCompletion",
    "direction": "in",
    "name": "TextCompletionResponse",
    "prompt": "Who is {name}?",
    "maxTokens": "100",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
}
```

## Running the Function App

1. Start Azurite for local development storage. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) for more information on how to work with Azurite.
1. Navigate to the folder samples\other\powershell

    ```bash
        cd samples/other/powershell
    ```

1. Build the extension dependency

    ```bash
        dotnet build --output bin
    ```

1. Run the function host

    ```bash
        func start
    ```

1. Use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send a request to the `WhoIs` function. The following is an example request:

```http
POST http://localhost:7071/api/whois/pikachu
```

The HTTP response should look something like the following example (with newlines added for readability):

```text
Pikachu is a fictional creature from the Pokï¿½mon franchise. It is a yellow
mouse-like creature with powerful electrical abilities and a mischievous
personality. Pikachu is one of the most iconic and recognizable characters
from the franchise, and is featured in numerous video games, anime series,
movies, and other media.
```
