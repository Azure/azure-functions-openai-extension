# Azure OpenAI Assistant Post Input Binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI assistant post input binding lets you send prompts to assistant chat bots.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about Azure OpenAI assistants, see [Azure OpenAI Assistants API](../ai-services/openai/concepts/assistants.md).

## Example

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-execution](../../includes/functions-dotnet-execution-model.md)]

### [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP POST function that sends user prompts to the assistant chat bot. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.

## Attributes

Apply the `PostUserQuery` attribute to define an assistant post input binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **Model** | The name of the OpenAI chat model to use. For Azure OpenAI, this value is the name of the model deployment. |

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
## Annotations

The `PostUserQuery` annotation enables you to define an assistant post input binding, which supports these parameters: 

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **name** | The name of the output binding. |
| **id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **model** | The name of the OpenAI chat model to use. For Azure OpenAI, this value is the name of the model deployment. |

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
## Decorators
<!--- Replace with typed decorator when available.-->
During the preview, define the output binding as a `generic_output_binding` binding of type `postUserQuery`, which supports these parameters:

|Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **arg_name** | The name of the variable that represents the binding parameter. |
| **id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **model** | The name of the OpenAI chat model to use. For Azure OpenAI, this value is the name of the model deployment. |

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"  
## Configuration  

The binding supports these configuration properties that you set in the function.json file.

|Property | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **type** | Must be `PostUserQuery`. |
| **direction** | Must be `out`. |
| **name** | The name of the output binding. |
| **id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **model** | The name of the OpenAI chat model to use. For Azure OpenAI, this value is the name of the model deployment. |
 
::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"  
## Configuration

The binding supports these properties, which are defined in your code: 

|Property | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **model** | The name of the OpenAI chat model to use. For Azure OpenAI, this value is the name of the model deployment. |
